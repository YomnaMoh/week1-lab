    <h1>YOMNAS&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;HOMEPAGE</h1>
    <h8>Describe your previous experience with coding</h8>
    <p>Last semester I took the Core 1 : Interaction class where we roughly went through the basics of CSS and HTML. Although we did not get deep into the logistics of the coding hands on - I  got to understand the web and the process of hosting a website. I find it difficult to understand the function of each tag and the ability to differentiate between CSS and HTML and the code setup for it all. I’ve designed and coded a few basic websites from start to finish but I don’t have the knowledge on the entire process so I can advance with my skills.</p>
    <h8>How are you feeling about learning to code in this class? Nervous? Excited?</h8>
    <p>I’m very excited to learn how to code and hopefully advance the skills I already have. I’m hoping the next few projects will allow for more creative freedom and personal concept development.</p>
    <h8>How do you imagine coding fitting in with the rest of your design curriculum and career after college?</h8>
    <p>Although I don’t think I’ll be pursuing a career with web development or design in the future - I feel as though, having those skills gives me possibilities to do more - so that i’m never limited.</p>
    <h8>Describe the relationship between HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Which one(s) are required to create a webpage?</h8>
    <p>HTML is the base of the site and contains content and text. CSS is the styling portion where you’re able to customize the webpage a little more - including color, font and layout. Javascript is used to add interactive behavior to webpages such as animate images or create dramatic movements with the content.</p>
    <h8>Describe what GitHub does</h8>
    <p>Github stores all your files in one place and publishes your site to the web.</p>
    <h8>My favorite foods:</h8>
    <h2>Sweet Potatoes</h2>
    <h3>Koshari</h3>
    <h4>Butter Chicken</h4>
    <h5>Cinnamon Rolls</h5>
    <h6>French Onion Soup</h6>
    <h7>Pão de queijo</h7>

    <h8>Create an unordered list and link 3 of your favorite graphic design or development-related websites. Within each list item, write a paragraph describing why the site is important or useful to you.</h8>
    <ul>
      <li>Brutalist Websites</li>
      <p>This is collection of brutalist websites that I refrence quite often. I enjoy the variety and creativity of the websites on here and look at them for inspiration. It's really great looking at how interaction could enhance your website - in a fun, exciting way or for a legitimate reason that solves a problem.</p>
      <li>Awge</li>
      <p>Awge is a website design created by Asap Rocky for his creative collective. I personally just really like this website. It's very visually striking and I like the style they were going for.</p>
    </ul>
    <h8>Insert an image that brings you joy. Make sure the image includes alt text that describes the image.</h8>     &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;

        <li>Japan</li>
      </ol>

      <h8>Write an HTML comment that is hidden from the browser but displays in the code. You can put anything you want in the comment, maybe try putting an easter egg for other developers looking at your code?</h8>
      <!— peak a boo this is my silly little hidden comment i cant wait to go to bed lol -->



      <h8>Create an unordered list with the names of 5 musical artists that you like to listen to. For each artist, create a class name based on their musical genre and apply it to the list item. Add CSS to style each class with a different color that fits the genre.</h8>
